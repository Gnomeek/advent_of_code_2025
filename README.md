# Advent of Code 2025 with Python

This repo is used to store my `Python` solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

This repo is grouped by day, every folder contains a sample input and solver. Solver is written in vanilla `Python` without dependencies except stdlib.

Run testcase by `cd dayn; python3 main.py test`

Run solver on real input by `cd dayn; python3 main.py`

The real input for each day is added in `.gitignore` on purpose.

Enjoy coding.
